## 🧠 About Me

I’m a Senior Full-Stack Software Engineer with 6+ years of experience designing, building, and operating scalable cloud-native systems.

Currently:
- 🏛️ Leading microservice architecture for a nationally-used platform at Accenture Federal Services (100M+ annual users)
- 🚀 Head of Backend and Web (equity) at Takes.live, where I architected and built the backend platform from scratch and also web application.
- 🤖 Integrating RAG + Generative AI into production systems
- 🏓 Building a sports-tech platform (ATLDink) from the ground up

My background spans:

- Java / Spring Boot microservices  
- Node.js / TypeScript backend systems  
- React / Next.js / Vue frontend platforms  
- AWS (GovCloud) + Google Cloud infrastructure  + Azure
- CI/CD automation & production reliability  + Docker
- Distributed systems & high-availability architecture  + Kubernetes

I design for:
- 🔁 Reliability under failure  
- 📈 Scalability under load  
- 🔒 Security & compliance  
- 🚀 Speed of iteration
